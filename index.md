# Strange Attractors

Under Construction !!! This site will collect images, animations, parameters, and integration methods for well-known chaotic systems.

> Tip: use the **Systems** section for equations + parameters, **Gallery** for visuals, **Integration** for numerics, and **Add-on** for the Blender tool.

## Quick example (Lorenz)

Inline example: $E = mc^2$.

Block (MathJax):

$$
\dot{x}=\sigma (y-x),\quad
\dot{y}=x(\rho - z)-y,\quad
\dot{z}=xy-\beta z.
$$
