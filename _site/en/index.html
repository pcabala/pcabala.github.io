    This website was created for those who wish to better understand the behavior 
    of nonlinear dynamical systems. It is intended both for researchers and 
    enthusiasts conducting experiments, as well as for artists and creators who 
    use attractors in animation, generative art, or other creative projects. 
    The <a href="/en/systems/lorenz/">Systems</a> section presents twenty well-known 
    nonlinear differential systems that generate characteristic structures 
    known as strange attractors. Each system includes a brief visualization 
    of its trajectories along with references to the original scientific sources. 
    The <a href="/en/methods/">Methods</a> section provides short explanations 
    of numerical integration algorithms. The <a href="/en/addon/">Add-on</a> 
	section describes a Blender plug-in 
    that enables generating, visualizing, and animating 
    trajectories in 3D space. Installing the add-on makes it possible to run 
    your own experiments, modify system parameters, test custom equations, 
    and create three-dimensional forms based on the dynamics of chaotic systems.

<p><strong>What is an attractor?</strong>
An attractor is a key concept in the science of dynamical systems. 
It describes a set of states toward which a system evolves over time. 
One can imagine it as a “magnet” in the space of possible behaviors, 
pulling trajectories of the system regardless of their initial positions. 
It is not a state of rest but rather a form of dynamic equilibrium: 
the motion remains confined within a certain region, yet its path never exactly repeats. 
This interplay of regularity and unpredictability gives attractors their unique character.</p>

<p><strong>From simple equations to complex behavior.</strong>
Every dynamical system is governed by mathematical rules—most often 
by systems of differential equations. These equations, although simple in form, 
can generate behaviors of astonishing complexity. Even though each subsequent state 
of the system is precisely determined by the previous one, the overall evolution may 
appear chaotic. This tension between the deterministic simplicity of rules and the 
unpredictable complexity of outcomes lies at the very foundation of chaos theory.</p>

<p><strong>Trajectories and phase space.</strong>
To understand how an attractor works, we visualize the system’s motion as a trajectory 
in so-called phase space. This is an abstract space in which each axis represents 
one variable describing the system’s state. When we observe the evolution of the system 
from different starting points, we notice that over time the trajectories begin to cluster 
around a certain subset of this space. That subset, which represents the geometric essence 
of the system’s dynamics, is what we call the attractor.</p>

<p><strong>Types of attractors: from points to fractals.</strong>
Attractors can take many forms — from single points (equilibrium states) and closed curves 
(limit cycles) to complex, fractal-like structures. The most intricate among them, 
known as strange attractors, are the hallmark of deterministic chaos. They are characterized 
by extreme sensitivity to initial conditions: even the slightest change at the start leads to 
a completely different trajectory later on—a phenomenon famously known as the butterfly effect. 
Detailed mathematical descriptions and examples can be found in the Systems section.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden order in chaos.</strong>
The study of attractors reveals that chaos is not synonymous with randomness but rather 
an expression of hidden order. Patterns that seem accidental are, in fact, the result 
of deterministic laws whose complexity prevents exact long-term prediction. 
It is at this boundary — between what is predictable and what is not — that the beauty 
and depth of dynamical systems emerge.</p>
