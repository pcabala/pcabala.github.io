<em>This website and the accompanying <b>Attractor Builder</b> add-on were created
as part of my work on the visualization and analysis of nonlinear dynamical
systems. The aim of the project is to provide clear and accessible tools for
performing numerical experiments, studying trajectories, and creating
three-dimensional visualizations of attractors directly in Blender.
If you have suggestions, improvement ideas, or notice any issues, 
feel free to reach out — the project is open to user feedback.</em>
