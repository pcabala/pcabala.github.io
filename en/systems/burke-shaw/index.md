<!-- a) Context and historical background -->
<p>
The <b>Burke–Shaw attractor</b> was proposed by Robert Shaw in 1981
during his studies on nonlinear chaotic flows conducted jointly
with physicist Bill Burke.
It represents an example of an <i>unbounded strange attractor</i> —
a system without fixed points,
whose trajectories can extend infinitely along one axis.
The original system of equations (1981, p. 104) is given by:
</p>

<!-- b) System of equations -->
<p class="mathline">\(\dot{x} = -10x - 10y\)</p>
<p class="mathline">\(\dot{y} = -10xz - y,\) \(\quad V = 13\)</p>
<p class="mathline">\(\dot{z} = 10xy + V\)</p>

<!-- c) Parameters and interpretation -->
<p>
In this system, the coefficient <i>a</i> defines the strength
of nonlinear coupling between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
while the parameter <i>b</i> acts as a constant offset
in the equation for <i>z</i>,
causing a slow drift of trajectories along the <i>z</i>-axis.
Although the flow is not bounded,
its solutions form a locally organized structure
exhibiting chaotic features,
known as the Burke–Shaw attractor.
